# Smart-Attendance-System-Based-on-Face-Recognition
The Smart Attendance System is a real-time project designed to automate the process of taking attendance using live camera feeds and face recognition technology. By leveraging the power of machine learning and the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, this system provides a robust and efficient solution for managing attendance in educational institutions. The core functionality is built using OpenCV for real-time image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, and Pickle for model serialization, ensuring high performance and accuracy. This innovative approach not only streamlines the attendance process but also minimizes manual errors, making it a valuable tool for teachers and administrators. Key skills employed in this project include computer vision, machine learning, and software development, all integrated to create a seamless and effective attendance management system.
